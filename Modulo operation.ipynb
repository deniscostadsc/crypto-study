    "Modulos operation finds the remainder after a division of one number by another[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)[\\[2\\]](https://youtu.be/W1SY6qKZrUk?t=1m19s)\n",

    "### Definition verification\n",

    "$a = 13 \\text{, } m = 9 \\text{ and }r = ?$\n",
    "\n",
    "$13 \\equiv 4 \\mod 9$\n",

    "Then we go back to the \"if\" part of the definition:\n",

    "$ m \\vert (a - r)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$9 \\vert (13 - 4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$9 \\vert 9$\n",
    "\n",
    "The we we got $9 \\vert 9$, that is true, because 9 is divisible. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Congruence classes\n",
    "\n",
    "That example above (when $a = 42$ and $m = 9$) can be rewritten as $42 = 3 \\cdot{9} + 15$, which is also true, as you can see below:\n",

    "\n",
    "$9 \\vert (42 + 3)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$9 \\vert 45$, that, of course, it is true.\n",

    "Like any congruence relation, congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence class of the integer a, denoted by an, is the set $\\{... , a - 2n, a - n, a, a + n, a + 2n, ...\\}$. This set, consisting of the integers congruent to a modulo n, is called the congruence class or residue class or simply residue of the integer a, modulo n. When the modulus n is known from the context, that residue may also be denoted [a].[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic)"
