    "Modulos operation finds the remainder after a division of one number by another[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)[\\[2\\]](https://youtu.be/W1SY6qKZrUk?t=1m19s)\n",

    "Let's say $a$, $r$, $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $m > 0$:\n",

    "$ m \\vert (a - r)$\n",

    "$9 \\vert (13 - 4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$9 \\vert 9$\n",
    "\n",
    "The we we got $9 \\vert 9$, that is true, because 9 is divisible. \n",

    "Here, $q$ is the quotient.\n",

    "$a = 42$ and $m = 9$\n",
    "\n",
    "$42 = 4 \\cdot{9} + 6$\n",
    "\n",

    "$9 \\vert 36$ that is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Congruence (or Equivalent) classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's to see on practice. The example above (when $a = 42$ and $m = 9$) can be rewritten as $42 = 3 \\cdot{9} + 15$, which is also true, as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$42 = 3 \\cdot{9} + 15$\n",

    "And keep doign this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{..., 0, 9, 18, 27, ...\\}$\n",
