Cryptology splits in two different branches Cryptography and Cryptanalysis.
First are focused in the design of crypto system and the second focused on
analysis and possible breaches o crypto systems. Cryptography has many
branches, the most known are symmetric and asymmtric algorithms and crypto
protocols. There are more branches below cryptography, but this course is going
to focus on those three.
