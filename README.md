# Cripto Study

This repository is destined to be a rich report about my study on Cryptography.
For now I'm taking the [Introduction to cryptography and Data Security](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aHkqB2-46k&list=PL6N5qY2nvvJE8X75VkXglSrVhLv1tVcfy)
classes presented by Professor Christof Paar at [Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum
](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index_en.htm).

The more courses I take, and probably I will, the more contentnI'll add to this
report.

So far the content here is:

* [Introduction](./introduction.md)
* [Modulo operation](https://github.com/deniscostadsc/crypto-study/blob/master/Modulo%20operation.ipynb)
* [Stream ciphers](https://github.com/deniscostadsc/crypto-study/blob/master/Stream%20Ciphers.ipynb)
