# Cripto Study

This repository is destined to be a rich report about my study on Cryptography.
For now I'm taking the [classes presented by Professor Christof Paar](

[Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index_en.htm).

The more courses I take, and probably I will, the more contentnI'll add to this
report.

So far the content here is:

* [Modulo operation](./Modulo operation.ipynb)
