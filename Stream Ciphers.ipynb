    "# Stream Ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "GSM is one example of Stream Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream cipher encrypts/decrypts bits individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{i} = e(x_{i}) \\equiv x_{i} + s_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{i} = d(y_{i}) \\equiv y_{i} + s_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, both functions use same operation for encryption and decryption. Let's prove both functions use same operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$d(y_{i}) \\equiv y_{i} + s_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw before, $y_{i} = x_{i} + s_{i}$, so we can replace the values on that equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d(y_{i}) \\equiv (x_{i} + s_{i}) + s_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$d(y_{i}) \\equiv x_{i} + 2s_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that $\\mod 2$ of any number multiplied by 2 is 0, so we can remove $2s_{i}$ from the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$d(y_{i}) \\equiv x_{i} \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: $\\mod 2$ addition and subtraction are the same operation!*\n",
    "\n",
    "That said we could rewrite $x_{i} = d(y_{i}) \\equiv y_{i} + s_{i} \\mod 2$, but the result will be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{i}, y_{i}, s_{i} \\in \\mathbb{z}_{2}$ and $\\mathbb{z}_{2} = \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mod 2 in depth\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a truth table for encription function.\n",
    "\n",
    " $x_{i}$ | $s_{i}$ | $y_{i} \\mod 2$ \n",
    ":-------:|:-------:|:--------------:\n",
    " 0       | 0       | 0\n",
    " 0       | 1       | 1\n",
    " 1       | 0       | 1\n",
    " 1       | 1       | 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\mod 2$ adition is the same as **XOR operation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some properties of XOR operation ($\\mod 2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we take a look on the truth table above, we can observe that if the input ($x_{i}$) is 0, the result (depending on the value $s_{i}$) can be 0 or 1. The same for 1 as input. So the result can assume each possible value (0 or 1) in 50% of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you XOR and number by 0, it keeps the same bit. When you XOR by 1 it flips the bit. So if the sender send 1 and $s_{i}$ is 0 the $y_{i}$ will keeps 1, even after decription process. But if sender send 1 and $s_{i}$ is 1, hte bit is flip into 0, as the ciphertext, and the decription funciton will flips the bit back to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice wants to send to Bob the letter \"A\" in ASCII encoding, which is 65 in the ASCII table. If we convert that to binary we end with \"1000001\". Let's assume a random key \"0101101\". So in the process of encrypt and send the cyphertext to Bob, we have this values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{7}...x_{1} = 1000001$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s_{7}...s_{1} = 0101101$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{7}...y_{1} = 1101100$\n",
    "\n",
    "If an attacker intercepts the cipher text and tries to interpret it, it will get the letter \"l\", in ASCII table. When Bob gets the message he needs to do the opposite process:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{7}...y_{1} = 1101100$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s_{7}...s_{1} = 0101101$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{7}...x_{1} = 1000001$\n",
    "\n",
    "A question that comes to our heads is \"How can we generate the key stream bit?'"
